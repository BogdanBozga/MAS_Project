# Fully Autonomous Indoor Farming System

## Overview

The Fully Autonomous Indoor Farming System is a Java-based simulation designed to demonstrate the capabilities of multi-agent systems within an indoor farming environment. Utilizing the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE), this application simulates various farming operations such as climate control, growth monitoring, irrigation, lighting control, nutrient management, harvesting, and logistics/distribution of produce. The system supports multiple plant types including Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Lettuce, and Herbs.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Implements several agents that manage different aspects of indoor farming operations, coordinating seamlessly to simulate a real indoor farm.
- **Real-Time Climate and Resource Management**: Adjusts climate conditions, irrigation, and nutrient supply in real-time based on the needs of each plant type.
- **Growth Monitoring and Harvesting**: Monitors the growth stages of plants and automates the harvesting process.
- **Interactive GUI**: Provides a graphical user interface for real-time monitoring and management of indoor farming operations.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Tracks revenue generated from the distribution of produce.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Includes comprehensive logging of actions and a monitoring system that oversees farm operations.
